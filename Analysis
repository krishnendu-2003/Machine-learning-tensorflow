# Analysis

1)The code shows a basic implementation of Linear Regression for predicting salaries based on years of experience.
2)The dataset seems to be small, containing only a few data points, which might limit the model's accuracy and generalization.
3)Since the dataset is small and the data is synthetic (provided as a list), it's not suitable for real-world applications.
4)The model's performance might not be highly reliable due to the limited data and the absence of a validation set.
5)If we want to use this code for real-world scenarios, it's essential to have a larger and diverse dataset for more accurate predictions.
6)We can further enhance the analysis by exploring more advanced regression techniques, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance.
7)I couldn't explore any other ML model due to lack in more active knowledge and time duration.
